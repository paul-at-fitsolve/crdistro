CR Page Manager Search
----------------------

It is initially renamed in order to prevent a namespace collision between the original
module and page manager in ctools module which defines page_manager_search_menu_alter

The CR Page manager search module adds the ability for Page manager pages to be
searchable via the Drupal core Search module or the Search API module.

In addition it permits deselecting pages from the set to be indexed and delivering
and defines additional fields for indexing and display.

The base Page manager search was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered)
of Realityloop Pty Ltd.
